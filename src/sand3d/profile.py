"""Profiles — the closed 2D regions solids are made from — and paths, the curves they follow.

A profile lies in its own XY plane, in the program's unit. Its outer loops run
anticlockwise and its holes clockwise. Every point records whether the outline
turns sharply there: the edges a solid grows from those points are its real
edges, the ones `fillet` and `chamfer` reach by name; the others only facet a
curve. `p + q` is the union of two profiles, `p - q` the first minus the second.
