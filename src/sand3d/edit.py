"""Edits: verbs that change a solid in place and return it.

Booleans are Blender's EXACT solver, one evaluation for any number of tools, run
on temporary copies in the target's own mesh space — the result never depends on
the depsgraph's state, the active object or the selection. Tools are consumed.

Names after a boolean: the edges where the operands meet are `cut`, plus the
name each tool was given (`hole`, `pocket`, `boss`…), plus `<target>.cut`, plus
the plain cap names of the faces they bound (a hole's mouth on the top is `top`
too). Plain names say where an edge is; qualified ones (`plate.top`) who made it. The
faces a cutting tool leaves behind are `cut` too; the tool's own plain names
(`top`, `side`) are dropped so they cannot be mistaken for the target's, and its
qualified ones (`slot.side`) are kept. An edge left lying flat between two
coplanar faces loses its names.
